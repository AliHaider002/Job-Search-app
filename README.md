# Expo Router Example

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## 🚀 How to use

1) Open the terminal in root folder of the project and Install the node modules.
```sh
npm install 
```
2) if you have dependency error?
```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
3) Start the React native app.
```sh
npx expo-cli start
```
4) Scan the QR code given in the terminal with your mobile Expo app (If you don't have install it from play Store or Apple Store).
5) Enjoy
